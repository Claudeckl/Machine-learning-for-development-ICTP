Machine Learning for Development
================================


Outline
-------

ICT puts information in the hands of engineers, managers,
decision makers. Information can take the form of "Big Data",
originating either in human activities, or generated by
sensors. The challenge is making sense of the data.

Traditionally, handling and evaluating data was mostly the
domain of statisticians, who developed
mathematical models and methods to classify numerical data,
find trends, make predictions. Even now, if you can hire
a good statistician, that is probably the safest way to get
usable information out of your data.

Impatient non-statisticians often tried to use various
visualization tools to understand their mountains of data;
but this could be dangerous, especially if important
decisions need to be made. Humans are very good at finding
patterns; the problem is they find patterns even when
there is none, only noise.

Recently, people increasingly turn to "Machine Learning",
or "Deep Learning" as an assistance to work with large
amounts of data and finding the information hidden in noise.
Such information can then be used to create new value.
For instance, when you browse the web and find curiously
interesting ads embedded in pages, they are placed there
by machine learning algorithms, that extract your shopping
habits and interests from the browsing history of you and
from many others.

Our workshop will introduce you to the basics of Machine
Learning (ML), through working with Mathematica (R) on the
Raspberry Pi computer.

We will use Mathematica, since it will let you do real
work in a few lines of code: it takes care of the messy
details of finding good "features" in the data, choosing
a good learning algorithm, executing it until the training
is finished, and letting you visualize the results again
in just a few lines.

We use Raspberry Pi since Wolfram Research, the creators of
Mathematica, are making it available freely ("free as in
beer") on this platform. But we have to note that Mathematica
on other platforms, like PC Linux, Mac, Windows, is not
free. If you want to work with Mathematica on your favorite
platform, you will need to purchase a licence, which might
be quite expensive.

By finishing the workshop, you will:
- understand basic the concepts and usage of Machine Learning
- become familiar with using Raspberry Pi as a computing platform
- become familiar with the basic usage of Mathematica on Raspberry Pi,
particularly in the context of Machine Learning algorithms
- experience running Machine Learning on sample data sets
- become ready to continue studying Machine Learning to attack
  real-world problems in your country

Using Raspberry Pi
------------------

###First steps

Let us prepare the system SD card, by copying the contents
of the "NOOBS" (New Out Of Box System) to a formatted blank
SD. Get the system distribution from [NOOBS][], then extract
the contents into a new directory. This contents will be
copied on the SD.

####On Linux:
Assuming that you have downloaded NOOBS_v1_9_2.zip into your
Downloads folder, and your SD is mounted as /media/NOOBS:

	cd
	unzip Downloads/NOOBS_v1_9_2.zip
	cd NOOBS_v1_9_2
	cp -a * /media/NOOBS/

####On Mac:
Assuming that you have downloaded NOOBS_v1_9_2.zip into your
Downloads folder, and your SD is mounted as /Volumes/NOOBS,
open a terminal and do the following:

	cd
	unzip Downloads/NOOBS_v1_9_2.zip
	cd NOOBS_v1_9_2
	cp -a * /Volumes/NOOBS/

####On Windows:
Assuming that you have downloaded NOOBS_v1_9_2.zip into your
Downloads folder, and your SD is drive D:, extract the contents
of the ZIP file into D:

Then unmount the SD, it is ready for booting.
