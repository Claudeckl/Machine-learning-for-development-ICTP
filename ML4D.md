Machine Learning for Development
================================


Outline
-------

ICT puts information in the hands of engineers, managers,
decision makers. Information can take the form of "Big Data",
originating either in human activities, or generated by
sensors. The challenge is making sense of the data.

Traditionally, handling and evaluating data was mostly the
domain of statisticians, who developed
mathematical models and methods to classify numerical data,
find trends, make predictions. Even now, if you can hire
a good statistician, that is probably the safest way to get
usable information out of your data.

Impatient non-statisticians often tried to use various
visualization tools to understand their mountains of data;
but this could be dangerous, especially if important
decisions need to be made. Humans are very good at finding
patterns; the problem is they find patterns even when
there is none, only noise.

Recently, people increasingly turn to "Machine Learning",
or "Deep Learning" as an assistance to work with large
amounts of data and finding the information hidden in noise.
Such information can then be used to create new value.
For instance, when you browse the web and find curiously
interesting ads embedded in pages, they are placed there
by machine learning algorithms, that extract your shopping
habits and interests from the browsing history of you and
from many others.

Our workshop will introduce you to the basics of Machine
Learning (ML), through working with Mathematica (R) on the
Raspberry Pi computer.
